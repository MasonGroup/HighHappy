## Introduction üöÄ

HighHappy is a virus created to demonstrate various destructive and disruptive techniques, including screen distortion, cursor manipulation, audio playback, and registry tampering. It is written in C# and leverages several Windows APIs to achieve its effects.

---

## Features üîß

- **GDI Effects:** Visual distortion of the screen using graphics manipulation.
- **MBR Modification:** Overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR) with random data.
- **Cursor Manipulation:** Randomly moves the cursor around the screen.
- **Icon Drawing:** Draws random system icons on the desktop.
- **ByteBeat Audio:** Generates and plays chaotic audio loops.
- **Simulated BSOD:** Terminates critical processes to crash the system.
- **Registry Deletion:** Deletes system-critical registry entries (implementation incomplete in provided code).

## Code Breakdown üìù

### GDI Effects
The `GDI` method uses the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) to manipulate the desktop display. It creates random visual distortions, including color fills and screen section copying.

### MBR Modification
The `MBR` method overwrites the Master Boot Record of the primary physical drive (`\\.\PhysicalDrive0`) with random bytes, rendering the system unbootable.

### Cursor Manipulation
The `Cursor` method randomly moves the mouse cursor across the screen at rapid intervals, creating a chaotic user experience.

### Icon Drawing
The `RunIconDrawing` method draws random system icons (error, warning, and application icons) at random positions on the desktop.

### ByteBeat Audio
The `ByteBeat` method generates chaotic audio loops using mathematical formulas. The audio is saved as a temporary WAV file and played in a continuous loop.

### Simulated BSOD
The `BSOD` method forcefully terminates all processes named `svchost`, potentially causing a system crash.

### Registry Deletion
The `RegistryDelete` method is designed to delete critical registry entries. However, its implementation is incomplete in the provided code.
